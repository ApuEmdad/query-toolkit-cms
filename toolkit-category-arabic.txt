ACCESS</strong></h3>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Save the Children recognizes that many of the most deprived and marginalized children are excluded from schools and learning spaces. The realization of the five foundations of the Quality Learning Framework is therefore dependent on ensuring all children, including the most deprived, have access to learning spaces. Proactive strategies must be in place to guarantee children access to education, informed by analyses of the barriers affecting children&rsquo;s right to education. Government, civil society, or service providers also play a role in shifting norms or providing programs that address the exclusionary factors affecting children&rsquo;s ability to access learning, such as disability, extreme poverty, displacement caused by conflict or natural disaster; or discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> - Adapted from The Quality Learning Framework, Save the Children</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Access is a foundational component of inclusive education, underscoring the fundamental right of all children to go to school and learn. Access encompasses attendance, enrolment, participation, retention, and transitioning from grade to grade in the expected progression, especially during emergencies, pandemics like COVID-19, and conflict situations. Ensuring that all children have access to quality and safe learning spaces, whether physical classrooms or remote learning sites and devices, contributes to the realization of the five foundations of the Quality Learning Framework. Access is based on the Right to Non-discrimination (Art.2, UN CRC), placing the onus on educators and parents to be aware of children who are not in school or participating, learning to their full individual potential, and identifying the barriers that prevent them from doing so.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some solutions to common factors that exclude children from school are provided here.

Effective teaching practices use inclusive child-centere strategies that directly elicit children&rsquo;s engagement and inquiry. Teachers use a range of questioning techniques including open questions to invite children&rsquo;s responses with their own ideas. Practices are responsive to the circumstances where learning takes place and deploy creative and intuitive strategies to adapt to large class sizes, mixed age groups, and different learning preferences and competencies. Differentiation is used to support all learners&rsquo; needs.
