Inclusive education seeks to identify and address barriers and discrimination that prevent some children from being supported to learn alongside their peers. The most common lenses of discrimination impacting students in education include disability, ethnicity, language, gender, sexual orientation, refugee status, socio-economic and cultural status, and poverty. Some of the resources featured in this Toolkit focus on a specific factor of exclusion, while others provide guidance on discrimination and barriers to learning more generally. Practitioners should use the tools that are most relevant to their context while keeping in mind that many children are impacted by intersecting barriers to inclusion. For example, a young boy with a physical disability from a majority language group will face different barriers to learning than a young girl from a minority language group. Children have overlapping identities. It is not possible to fully address one type of discrimination without also considering the other aspects of exclusion that might also be interfering.</p><p>The increased global focus on inclusive education stems from efforts to guarantee the Right to Education1 to large numbers of out-of-school children who are excluded from access to quality education because of social, economic, and cultural stigma and discrimination. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated challenges for those most marginalized and excluded children. The inability of Governments and the Global Community to guarantee an appropriate quality education to all children not only constitutes a huge personal loss, but also limits their potential contribution to society and country. To counteract such a loss of human resources on a global scale, the Sustainable Development Goal #4 of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promotes inclusion and equity through quality education and lifelong learning for all as the pathway to a more just, tolerant, equal, and peaceful world.</p></div><div class=\"col-lg-9 col-sm-12\"><p><img class=\"w-100\" src=\"/storage/photos/1/home/CH1544395-_2_.webp\" alt=\"home2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated challenges</em></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em> for those most marginalized and excluded children.</em></p></div><div class=\"col-lg-7 col-sm-12\"><p>Save the Children Italy and Save the Children Sweden, thanks to the support of the IKEA Foundation and through various institutional and private funds, have worked to further Inclusion in Education in recent years through several initiatives.

The realization of the five foundations of the Quality Learning Framework is therefore dependent on ensuring all children, including the most deprived, have access to learning spaces. Proactive strategies must be in place to guarantee children access to education, informed by analyses of the barriers affecting children&rsquo;s right to education. Government, civil society, or service providers also play a role in shifting norms or providing programs that address the exclusionary factors affecting children&rsquo;s ability to access learning, such as disability, extreme poverty, displacement caused by conflict or natural disaster; or discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. - Adapted from The Quality Learning Framework, Save the Children Access is a foundational component of inclusive education, underscoring the fundamental right of all children to go to school and learn. Access encompasses attendance, enrolment, participation, retention, and transitioning from grade to grade in the expected progression, especially during emergencies, pandemics like COVID-19, and conflict situations. Ensuring that all children have access to quality and safe learning spaces, whether physical classrooms or remote learning sites and devices, contributes to the realization of the five foundations of the Quality Learning Framework. Access is based on the Right to Non-discrimination (Art.2, UN CRC), placing the onus on educators and parents to be aware of children who are not in school or participating, learning to their full individual potential, and identifying the barriers that prevent them from doing so. Some solutions to common factors that exclude children from school are provided here. As many reasons constrain children from attending school, cross-references are made to other domains that may provide more in-depth solutions.</p></div><div class=\"col-lg-4 col-12\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-lg-12 col-12\"><div class=\"v-image v-responsive theme--light\"><div class=\"v-responsive__sizer\"><img class=\"w-100\" src=\"/storage/photos/1/access/access.png\" alt=\"access\" /></div></div></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-lg-12 col-12\"><p class=\"access-p-font\"><span style=\"font-family: roboto;\">&ldquo;Ensuring that all children have access to quality and safe learning spaces, whether physical classrooms or remote learning sites and devices, contributes to the realization of the five foundations of the Quality Learning Framework.&rdquo;</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"box-card\"><div class=\"row justify-center\"><div class=\"v-card v-sheet v-sheet--outlined theme--light elevation-0\"><h3>While working with teachers, children, government officials, and communities, keep asking yourself:</h3><p>1.

Some conditions which may mean that a person has an intellectual disability are Down syndrome or autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>Neurological impairments are those affecting the spinal cord and brain functions and include, but are not limited to, spinal cord injury, spina bifida,hydrocephalus and cerebral palsy.</p><p>Physical impairments include, but are not limited to, missing or deformation of limb orbodily structure, short stature, speech impediment and restricted mobility of the physical body.</p><p>Psychosocial impairments are those linked to mental health, cognitive conditions or disturbance in behavior that are perceived as socially unacceptable. They include but are not limited to people who have received a mental health-related diagnosis or who self- identify as having a psychosocial disability due to high levels of distress, for instance Sensory impairments are those affecting people&rsquo;s senses. They include visual impairments, blind, partially sighted, low vision, hearing impairments, D/deaf, mild, moderate, or profound hearing loss or hard of hearing, deafblind, and hypersensitivity.</p><p><strong> Inclusion</strong></p><p>process of taking necessary steps to ensure that every young person is given an equality of opportunity to develop socially, to learn, and to enjoy community life. It is often associated with groups of young people: those with disabilities, from ethnic minority communities, with HIV and AIDS, and coming from certain regions, cities, or neighborhoods.</p><p><strong> Inclusive Education</strong></p><p>according to UNESCO, inclusive education means that all children can learn together in the same school. This entails reaching out to all learners and removing all barriers that could limit participation and achievement. Disability is one of the main causes of exclusion; however, there are also other social, institutional, physical, and attitudinal barriers to inclusive education.</p><p><strong>Indicator</strong></p><p>objective way of measuring that progress is being achieved that can refer to each level: input, output, outcome, objective, or impact. Indicators provide an indication that something has happened, or that an objective has been achieved.</p><p><strong>Individual Education Plan (IEP) / </strong></p><p>plan describing and defining the need for support of those learners with an official decision of individual educational needs, usually established by a multidisciplinary team. It is the tool exemplifying how the different systems of support are organized around an individual learner with disabilities and the way in which local agencies can be coordinated and progress can be monitored (European Agency, 2013, p.41)</p><p><strong> Individual Needs </strong></p><p>individual or unique, out-of-the-ordinary concerns created by a person&rsquo;s medical, physical, mental, or developmental condition or disability.
